# Welcome to TTK Examples

This website hosts a list of data analysis pipelines exemplifying TTK's usage with
[ParaView](http://paraview.org) and its Python API `pvpython`.

The website is targeting novice users would are not power users of [ParaView](http://paraview.org), and who would like to get started with topological data analysis with TTK in Python.

Each example includes a screenshot (or a tutorial video), the command to execute to reproduce the example with [ParaView](http://paraview.org) as well as the corresponding Python code to process the input data, and store the output of the analysis pipeline to disk.

This documentation assumes a default TTK installation, with the `pvpython` API support enabled.
